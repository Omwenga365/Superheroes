# Rails Code Challenge - Superheroes

## Project Guidelines

For this assessment, we'll be working on an API for tracking heroes and their superpowers.


## Setup

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
2. cd into the project directory
3. Run `bundle install` command to install all necessary gems
4. Run `rails db:migrate` command to create the database tables
5. Run `rails db:seed` command to populate the database with sample data
6. Start the server with `rails server` command
7. Use Postman to make requests to the API endpoints



## Models

You need to create the following relationships:

- A `Hero` has many `Power`s through `HeroPower`
- A `Power` has many `Hero`s through `HeroPower`
- A `HeroPower` belongs to a `Hero` and belongs to a `Power`

## Validations

Add validations to the `HeroPower` model:

- `strength` must be one of the following values: 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Average'

Add validations to the `Power` model:

- `description` must be present and at least 20 characters long

## Routes

Set up the following routes. Make sure to return JSON data in the format
specified along with the appropriate HTTP verb.

### GET /heroes

Return JSON data in the format below:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Kamala Khan", "super_name": "Ms. Marvel" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Doreen Green", "super_name": "Squirrel Girl" },
  { "id": 3, "name": "Gwen Stacy", "super_name": "Spider-Gwen" }
]
```

### GET /heroes/:id

If the `Hero` exists, return JSON data in the format below:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Kamala Khan",
  "super_name": "Ms. Marvel",
  "powers": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "super strength",
      "description": "gives the wielder super-human strengths"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "flight",
      "description": "gives the wielder the ability to fly through the skies at supersonic speed"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `Hero` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with
the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Hero not found"
}
```

### GET /powers

Return JSON data in the format below:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "super strength",
    "description": "gives the wielder super-human strengths"
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "flight",
    "description": "gives the wielder the ability to fly through the skies at supersonic speed"
  }
]
```

### GET /powers/:id

If the `Power` exists, return JSON data in the format below:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "super strength",
  "description": "gives the wielder super-human strengths"
}
```

If the `Power` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with
the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Power not found"
}
```

### PATCH /powers/:id

This route should update an existing `Power`. It should accept an object with
the following properties in the body of the request:

```json
{
  "description": "Updated description"
}
```

If the `Power` exists and is updated successfully (passes validations), update
its description and return JSON data in the format below:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "super strength",
  "description": "Updated description"
}
```

If the `Power` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with
the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Power not found"
}
```

If the `Power` is **not** updated successfully (does not pass validations),
return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```

### POST /hero_powers

This route should create a new `HeroPower` that is associated with an
existing `Power` and `Hero`. It should accept an object with the following
properties in the body of the request:

```json
{
  "strength": "Average",
  "power_id": 1,
  "hero_id": 3
}
```

If the `HeroPower` is created successfully, send back a response with the data
related to the `Hero`:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Kamala Khan",
  "super_name": "Ms. Marvel",
  "powers": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "super strength",
      "description": "gives the wielder super-human strengths"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "flight",
      "description": "gives the wielder the ability to fly through the skies at supersonic speed"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `HeroPower` is **not** created successfully, return the following
JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```
